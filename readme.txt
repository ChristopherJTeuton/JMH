Perfect, thanks!

The game will be called "Josh's Mushroom Hunt" and, instead of baking cookies, players will be foraging for mushrooms. Players should be able to name their own Mushroom Company and that name should be displayed at all times.

To forage for mushrooms, players will click on a picture of a mushroom, which will function like clicking the cookie in Cookie Clicker. This picture will be saved in the game folder as mushroomIcon.png.

Players should be able to see how many mushrooms they have foraged at all times, along with the amount of Mushrooms per second they are currently gaining.

Players should also have the ability to purchase automatic mushroom foraging upgrades, like how Cookie Clicker escalates to Grandmas and Cookie Factories. Each new upgrade costs a certain amount of cookies, and the cost should exponentially increase as more devices are unlocked.

Players should be able to see how many mushrooms the next two upgrades cost at any given time. Upgrades past the next two should be marked as ??? and be unpurchaseable until the player buys the appropriate upgrades.

The upgrades should be displayed as buttons the player can click, and change color when they are hovered over.

The upgrades should not disappear when purchased, and players can buy multiples of the same upgrade.

Once the player clicks on the button to purchase an item, the text description of that upgrade should appear on screen. This text description is found below on the line underneath the upgrade's number.

The upgrades should come with descriptions, and there should be at least 20 purchaseable upgrades in total. The first upgrade should cost 25 mushrooms, the next 50, the next 100, and so on. Here is the order of the upgrades, along with their descriptions and what they give the player: 
1. Professional Forager
Hire a professional forager to search the woods for mushrooms. +1 Mushrooms per second.
2. Retired Pig
Purchase a professional (but retired) pig to root out better mushrooms. +5 Mushrooms per second.
3. Morel Magnet
Order a special device that automatically pulls Morel mushrooms to you. +10 Mushrooms per second.
4. Oyster Mushroom Shucker
Purchase an automatic shucker that peels Oyster mushrooms away from trees. +20 Mushrooms per second.
5. Mushroom Farm
Needed to grow your own mushrooms. +30 Mushrooms per second.
6. Mushroom Processing Plant
Needed to turn mushrooms into other materials. +40 Mushrooms per second.
7. Poison Control System
Replaces all poisonous mushrooms with tasier options. +50 Mushrooms per second.
8. Shiitake Censor Board
Petition the government to pass a law stating people can't make jokes about Shiitake mushrooms anymore. +60 Mushrooms per second.
9. Mushroom Transport Ship
Allows the purchase and selling of mushrooms overseas. +70 Mushrooms per second.
10. Mushroom Embassy
Establish an embassy in a foreign country. +80 Mushrooms per second.
11. Experimental Mushroom Powder
Applies a new, untested chemical to your mushrooms which should allow them to grow faster. +90 Mushrooms per second.
12. Offshore Genetic Testing Facility
A safe place to perform experiments on mushrooms away from prying eyes. +100 Mushrooms per second.
13. Underground Planters
Dig out tunnels underneath major cities to plant your new mushrooms. +120 Mushrooms per second.
14. Mushroom Lobbyists
Influence the political system to increase support of all mushroom-based products. +140 Mushrooms per second.
15. Satellite Broadcasting Network

16. Reorganize City Infrastructure
Begin digging up roads and parking lots to make space for more mushrooms. +170 Mushrooms per second.
17. Ensure Mushroom Survival
Sends a rocket filled with mushrooms to a predetermined planet. +180 Mushrooms per second.
18. Deploy ACME-brand Weather Control Unit
Utilize newfound technology to make global temperatures perfect for mushroom growth. +200 Mushrooms per second.
19. Activate Mushrooom Enhancement Beam
Allows mushrooms to grow at ungodly speed. +500 Mushrooms per second.
20. Unleash Them.
(For example, the first upgrade button should be labeled "Professional Forager (Cost: 25 Mushrooms)" and, when clicked, text should appear underneath the main image (mushroomIcon.png) that says "You hired a professional forager to search the woods for mushrooms. +1 Mushrooms per second".)

Unlike the other 19 upgrades, when "Unleash Them" is clicked the screen should be wiped and the player should be presented with this message:
"The enhanced mushroom soldiers left few humans alive that day. The world wept, and the world reeked. Those who did survive were forced into hiding, and soon the only way they could travel was via submarine. That's the legacy [PLAYER'S MUSHROOM FARM NAME] left to the world. Thanks for playing."
That is how the game ends.

Additionally, during the entirety of gameplay I would like there to be a box-shaped section always on screen called "Mushroom Facts!". Inside this box should be a sentence stating an interesting fact about mushrooms, and this sentence should change randomly every 8 seconds. Here are some examples of mushroom facts, but when you are building out the code please include at least 10 different ones:
The world's largest living organism is actually a mushroom!
Mushrooms are genetically more similar to humans than they are plants!
Some mushrooms can glow in the dark!
Despite the name, magicians don't use magic mushrooms in their act!
Some mushrooms have been known to turn ants into zombies!

I would like for you to display the code for this game in such a way that I can copy it into Notepad files and play it on my browser. Does all of that make sense?
